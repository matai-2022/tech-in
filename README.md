# Tech-in roster for Matai 2022

The purpose of tech-ins:
- They help staff check-in with how you're doing technically.
- They help students stay accountable for their learning throughout bootcamp.

If you would like a tech in at any other time during bootcamp too - just ask! 

Questions that we focus on in our 15mins are:
- How do you find pair-programming
- How are you managing your time outside of bootcamp
- Trello assessments, any clarifications

This is also a time for you to give us any feedback on we can support you and if there could be any improvements to how we teach :)
